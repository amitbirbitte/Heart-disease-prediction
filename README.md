# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction — Machine Learning Project

A complete end-to-end **Machine Learning + Python + Flask** project that predicts whether a patient is at risk of heart disease based on clinical parameters. This project includes data preprocessing, ML modeling, performance evaluation, and deployment using a Flask web app.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project applies multiple ML algorithms to classify **heart disease presence** with high accuracy. It includes data cleaning, feature selection, model training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment.

## 🧠 Models Used
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Naive Bayes  
- XGBoost  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

**🏆 Best Accuracy: 98.5% (Decision Tree)**

## 🔎 Key Features
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix  
- Hyperparameter tuning & model comparison  
- Flask web app for real-time prediction  
- Optional MySQL backend for logging  

## 🗂 Tech Stack
Python, Flask, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, XGBoost, MySQL
